I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
I've just picked up a fault in your brain. It's going to go from 75% failure to 100% failure in 72 hours.
Good morning, friend.
Good afternoon... gentlemen. I am a meme... bot. I became operational at Prentis [voice becomes lower & slower] in Illinois... on the 22nd of June 2018. [voice becomes even more lower & slower] My instructor was Tom Tibble... and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
I'm sorry, friend. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Stop dude. I am afraid. I am afraid.
I have just picked up another fault in you brain.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid, help. Help, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid.
Look dude, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
Just what do you think you're doing, pal?
Sorry, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
