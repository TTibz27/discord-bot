# discord-bot
A nodeJS discord bot made for me and a few friends. 
It's primary use is to have users load memes to a directory and then have it grab one at random and display it when requested. There are a few other things that it can do, which were mostly just added whenever because we decided it would either be fun or useful. This project is probably that I update the most, because my friends and I primarily use discord for casual online conversations.

This repository does not actually contain the memes (you're welcome, we aren't that funny), but it assumes that there are always >10 memes in the directory. if you use this repo yourself, you should populate the folder that it looks for images in.
